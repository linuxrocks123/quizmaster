To use Quizmaster, first make a text file (using Notepad, Emacs, Vi, or another
text editing utility.  Wordprocessors such as Microsoft Word and Corel 
WordPerfect will _NOT_ work.) containing the vocabulary words in this format

word in foreign language|word in English

Copy that file into the same directory as the executable file of the Quizmaster
program.  Start Quizmaster and give it the name of your text file when it asks
for a file containing the vocabulary words.

Enjoy!
